# DPEV2 - Commands

Here, you can find some commands that I have done for the client bot "DPEV2" made by <a href="//xat.me/Majora">Majora</a>. <br />

You can find videos on <strong>how to install it</strong>, <strong>how to use it</strong> and a full document <a href="https://pastebin.com/0s9uR0B5">here</a>:

</ul>

If you know what to do with these commands, this is good for you because I'm not going to help you. ðŸ˜Ž<br />

All I can say is that the commands are under the <strong>filters/commands</strong> folders.
